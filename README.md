I have completed the Task 2 of the coding heist which included the functionality of directly signing in with Gmail

Step 1: Creating a project on Google cloud platform to recieve the Clent ID and Client secret to use the OAuth consent screen API for the website (url of localhost also works).
Step 2: Installing the Google api client through composer (Run the command in command prompt: composer require google/apiclient:"^2.0")
Step 3: Set the client id and secret recieved from google on the index.php file and run it on localhost.
